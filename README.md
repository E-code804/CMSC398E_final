# Hypothesis: 
Booking status is dependent on the average price of the booking,
the number of children the reserver(s) have, and the number of week/weekend days booked.
# Null Hypothesis: 
Booking status is NOT dependent on the average price of the booking,
the number of children the reserver(s) have, and the number of week/weekend days booked.
# RESULT:
According to the statistics from the model, the p-value was < 2.2e-16.
Therefore, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis for any alpha significance level
and conclude that booking status DOES depend on the average price of the booking,
the number of children the reserver(s) have, and the number of week/weekend days booked.
